# 🏗️ **Data Warehouse Architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold)**

This project follows the modern **Medallion Architecture** to create a scalable, analytics-ready warehouse.

---

## 🥉 **Bronze Layer — Raw Ingestion**

The Bronze layer stores raw CRM, ERP, and sales files exactly as received.

### **Purpose**

* Preserve raw data
* Maintain source-of-truth
* Act as input for all transformations

### **Key Actions**

* No transformations
* No standardization
* Loaded using `BULK INSERT`

---

## 🥈 **Silver Layer — Clean / Standardized Zone**

The Silver Layer applies business cleaning and data standardization:

✔ Deduplication                                                                                        
✔ Data type corrections                                                                                          
✔ Date parsing                                                                                                          
✔ Product-line normalization                                                                                          
✔ Customer gender/marital standardization                                                                            
✔ Missing value imputation                                                                                            
✔ Sales recalculation rules                                                                                                  

The result: **clean, validated, business-ready staging tables**.

# 📌 **Key Insights & Business Recommendations**

### 🔹 **1. Strengthen Early Customer Engagement**

Cohort retention drops sharply after Month 2–3.                                                                                          
**Recommendation:**
Introduce onboarding campaigns, reminder notifications, and early-purchase incentives to improve early lifecycle retention.

---

### 🔹 **2. Prioritize High-Value Customer Segments (Champions & Loyal)**

RFM analysis shows these customers generate the majority of revenue.                                                                                                        
**Recommendation:**
Create premium loyalty benefits, targeted promotions, and exclusive offers to maintain long-term value.

---

### 🔹 **3. Reactivate At-Risk & Hibernating Customers**

These groups represent lost revenue opportunities.
**Recommendation:**
Launch reactivation campaigns—discount reminders, personalized product recommendations, and seasonal offers.                                                  

---

### 🔹 **4. Optimize Product Portfolio**

Top performer products generate dominant profit while dormant products show declining trends.                                                          
**Recommendation:**
Increase stock & marketing for high performers; reprice, bundle, or retire underperforming SKUs.

---

### 🔹 **5. Leverage High-Profit Price Segments**

Exclusive/Signature tiers produce the highest profit contribution.                                                                    
**Recommendation:**
Focus upselling strategies to move mid-tier customers into premium product lines.

---

### 🔹 **6. Expand Customer Value Through Upsell/Cross-Sell**

Large number of customers fall under low Monetary score groups.                                                      
**Recommendation:**
Offer product bundles, personalized recommendations, and frequency-based discounts.

---

### 🔹 **7. Monitor Long-Term Retention Trends**

Cohort patterns show acquisition quality shifts over time.                                                                        
**Recommendation:**
Use Cohort page regularly to evaluate marketing effectiveness and customer loyalty patterns.
